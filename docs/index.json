I am fortunate to have Professor Edgar Walker as my advisor, and work closely with the UW Computational Neuroscience Center. Previously I received my M.D. and B.Sc. in Physics at National Taiwan University in 2020.\nI am interested in how neural circuits, dynamics, and computation support the complex phenomena of cognition, behavior, and intelligence in organmisms. I study how biological and artificial intelligent systems adapt under uncertainty, with a focus on reinforcement learning, Bayesian inference, and meta-learning. Please visit my research page for more details!\nAside from research, I enjoy reading, cooking, and baseball.\nContact Email: pckuo [at] uw [dot] edu\nOffice: Magnuson Health Sciences Building, 1705 NE Pacific Street, Seattle, WA 98195\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"http://pckuo.github.io/authors/admin/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/admin/","section":"authors","summary":"I am Po-Chen Kuo, a 3rd-year Ph.D. candidate studying computational neuroscience at University of Washington and a visiting scientist at the Allen Institue for Neural Dynamics.
