I am Po-Chen Kuo, a 3rd-year Ph.D. candidate studying computational neuroscience at [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/) and a visiting scientist at the [Allen Institue for Neural Dynamics](https://alleninstitute.org/what-we-do/brain-science/research/allen-institute-neural-dynamics/). I am fortunate to have Professor [Edgar Walker](https://edgarwalker.com/) as my advisor, and work closely with the [UW Computational Neuroscience Center](https://compneuro.washington.edu/). Previously I received my [M.D.](https://www.mc.ntu.edu.tw/ntucm/Index.action) and [B.Sc. in Physics](https://www.phys.ntu.edu.tw/enphysics/Default.html) at [National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/) in 2020. 

I am interested in how neural circuits, dynamics, and computation support the complex phenomena of cognition, behavior, and intelligence in organmisms. I study how biological and artificial intelligent systems adapt under uncertainty, with a focus on reinforcement learning, Bayesian inference, and meta-learning. Please visit my research page for more details!

Aside from research, I enjoy reading, cooking, and baseball.
